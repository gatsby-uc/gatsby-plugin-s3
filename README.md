Enables you to deploy your gatsby site to a S3 bucket.  
Requires very little configuration, while optimizing your site as much as possible.

## Features:

- üì¶ Fully handles the deployment process for you, all you need to configure is your bucket name.
    - Automatically creates/updates bucket with optimal configuration applied.
    - Syncs gatsby files to the bucket & updates metadata.
- ‚è≠ Redirects.
- üíæ Optimizes caching for you.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Optional serverless framework support if you want to take things a step further.
- ‚úèÔ∏è Add your own params to uploaded S3 objects (if you wish).

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
npm i gatsby-plugin-s3
```

### Configuration

Add the plugin to your `gatsby-config.js` & configure the bucket name and ACL (required):

```js
plugins: [
  {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-s3`,
      options: {
          bucketName: 'my-website-bucket',
          acl: 'public-read'
      },
  },
]
```

Optionally, set the ACL to `null` if you wish to keep your bucket private (which is the default).  
Note that your site will not be viewable by anyone but you if you do so.  
Read [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) about all available ACL's.

### Deployment

Add a deployment script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    ...
    "deploy": "gatsby-plugin-s3 deploy"
}
```

Optionally you can skip the confirmation prompt automatically by adding `--yes` like so:  
```js
    "deploy": "gatsby-plugin-s3 deploy --yes"
```
When `gatsby-plugin-s3` detects a [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) environment, it will automatically skip this prompt by default.

After configuring credentials (see below), you can now execute `npm run build && npm run deploy` to have your site be build and immediately deployed to S3.

## Configuration
Most of the aspects of the plugin can be configured.  
Default configuration is as follows:  

```typescript
{
    bucketName: '',
    region: undefined,
    protocol: undefined,
    hostname: undefined,
    params: {},
    mergeCachingParams: true,
    generateRoutingRules: true,
    generateIndexPageForRedirect: true,
    generateMatchPathRewrites: true,
    removeNonexistentObjects: true,
    customAwsEndpointHostname: undefined
};
```

## Recipes

Several recipes are available:

### Adding environment specific settings

Learn how to retrieve AWS credentials from a .env file.
Additionally setup a different bucket name depending on your environment.

- [See the recipe](recipes/with-dotenv.md)

### Using a different content type for files

Learn how to override the content type gatsby-plugin-s3 sets on your files.

- [See the recipe](recipes/custom-content-type.md) 


### Using CloudFront with gatsby-plugin-s3

CloudFront is a global CDN and can be used to make your blazing fast Gatsby site load even faster, particularly for first-time visitors. Additionally, CloudFront provides the easiest way to give your S3 bucket a custom domain name and HTTPS support.  

- [See the recipe](recipes/with-cloudfront.md) 

### Using serverless with gatsby-plugin-s3

[Serverless](https://serverless.com) can be used in combination with gatsby-plugin-s3, swapping the plugin's deployment step for `sls deploy` instead.  
Serverless will give you the added advantage of being able to add multiple AWS services such as Lambda, CloudFront, and more all in the same repo, deployment step and CloudFormation stack while still being able to profit from all the optimisations gatsby-plugin-s3 does.

- [See the `with-serverless` example](examples/with-serverless)  


### Using Yandex S3 or any AWS supported services with gatsby-plugin-s3
To use Yandex S3 or any supported AWS services you need only to change region & customAwsEndpointHostname params (provided by service) before deploy.
Yandex example:
```typescript
{
    bucketName: 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME',
    region: 'us-east-1',
    customAwsEndpointHostname: 'storage.yandexcloud.net'
};
```
